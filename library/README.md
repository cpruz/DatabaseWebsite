# Library Management Database Project

This project is to demonstrate an understanding of SQL. I designed a website using Python and Flask, 
using SQLite for the database. This program is used to keep track of all of a libraries information.
For example, the books, authors, publishers, and members. Using the website you can interact with all
of the data and can view lists of all the data that is held.
