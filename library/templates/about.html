        This website is designed to hold all of the information relating to a library.
        A SQLite database holds information about all of the books, authors, publishers, and members of the library.
        The website allows for books to be searched for by different criteria and manages what books are available.
        Members have expiration dates for their memberships and that can also be monitored. The website offers many
        different ways to search for books, authors, publishers, and members. For example, books can be searched for
        by genre, author, publisher, length, title, etc.
